<!--I got errors saying that ul and ol and p cannot be children of div in this context, but I belive this was the code you helped me write in your office hours.
I tried just remivng the div tags but it broke all of my style changes so I changed it back. 
It did confuse me though so maybe we can go over it sometime?-->
